What is a programming language?
- it is a human-readable language that we use to instructions to our computer machines which
  internally compiles it into its native machine code & performs operation.
- it is easy and efficient for developers to interact with the machines.

3 types of languages --->

1. Procedural -
  - contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to perform
    a task.
    And all languages like java, c, python follow these.

2. Functional -
  - function is a block of instructions that are meant to perform a specific operation
  - it can be reused anywhere we want in the program just by calling it.
  - pure function ? functions whose inputs are not modified,
  and gives correct output for the input
  - a program which is completely written in pure functions is nothing but functional
    programming.
