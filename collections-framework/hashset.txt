- implemented class of set interface present in java.util package
- underline data structure of hashset is hashtable
- hashset is backed up by map
- introduced in jdk 1.2

** properties
- not an index based data structure
- stores values on the basis of hashcode
- it internally stores the element in a map as a key
- since, keys are unique, it does not allow duplicate elements & only one null value is used
- can store different data types
- does not follow insertion order
- it is not sorted
- it is non synchronized (allows concurrent execution of threads making performance fast but data inconsistency might occur)

** constructors
1. HashSet()
2. HashSet(Collection c)
3. HashSet(int initialCapacity) // default capacity = 10
4. HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)

** methods
- inherited of collection interface like add, addAll, remove, removeAll, contains, isEmpty etc.
