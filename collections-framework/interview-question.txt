1. What is collection framework?
2. Hierarchy?
3. Difference between collection and array?
4. Difference between collection and collections class?
5. Difference between arraylist & vector?
6. Difference between list and set
7. What happens we insert a duplicate element in set, it will return false
8. If we want to follow the insertion order, with unique elements, we should use LinkedHashSet
9. What are fail-fast and fail-safe collections
10. Why does fail fast collection throw ConcurrentModificationException
11. Why does fail safe collection not throw ConcurrentModificationException
12. Internal working for hashset?
- calls put method of map internally where the value is stored on key and at value by default
  a static variable PRESENT is inserted which is an object instance
13. Which collection can be used to sort on the basis of salary --> TreeSet using comparator
    if we don't use comparator, it by default uses comparable
    it should have objects of classes must implement comparable & homogenous
    it internally uses compareTo--> we cannot use null values, it will throw null pointer
    if we try to store heterogenous exceptions --> it throws ClassCastException
14. What happens if we try to store two objects with same content in the hashset
    What happens if equals() is override ?
    What happens if hashcode() is override ?
    The nodes are added until the size is 8 and then converted to tree
15. What to do when we want to make collections thread safe?
