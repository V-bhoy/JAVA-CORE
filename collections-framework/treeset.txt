- directly inherits navigableSet & indirectly inherits SortedSet and Set interface
- present in java.util package introduced in jdk 1.2
- the underline data structure is balanced tree

** properties
- not index-based data structure
- does not follow insertion order
- it is sorted
- stores homogenous element otherwise throws exception
- cannot store duplicate elements
- does not allow null values, before 1.6 it was allowed in first position, but that is also removed (NullPointerException)
  since it cannot compare null values
- it is non-synchronized

Internally, whenever we insert an element it uses the compareTo method present in Comparable interface to check if the
objects are equal, if it returns a positive value, it compares with the next element node or placed on the right side,
it is placed on its left or is compared wih the left node, if its +ve, placed on right else left
ex 40 ---->  40
   60 ----> [40-->60]
   20 ---> [20<-----40------>60]
   30 ----> 20<-----40------>60
            20------>30 (here 20 is the same node)

While retrieving, it will start from left, top and then right on each branch
in this case there is no element on the left for node 20, so skips, it fetches 20, 30, 40, 60
