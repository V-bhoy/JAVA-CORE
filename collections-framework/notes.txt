Problems with array:
- fixed in size, cannot modify the size once declared
- not based on some standard data structure, we do not have ready-made methods to perform
  simple operations easily like sorting, removing an element etc.
- we need to write a lot of code for simple operations making it difficult for us when working with
  arrays

What is a collection framework ?
- unified structure or framework that provides a set of interfaces, classes and methods to store
  manipulate and retrieve a group of objects or elements in a structured/organized way providing
  a ready-made architecture
- provides a set of standard data structures such as List, Queue, Set, Map and provides a set of
  methods to perform operations on these data structures such adding, removing, modifying elements,
  iterating over elements and searching for elements

Collection ?
- interface in the collection framework
- represents a group of objects
- defines basic functionalities that all collections share such as adding, removing, iterating
  over elements etc.
- common implementations - List, Set, Queue

Collections ?
- utility class that provides a set of static methods to work with collection
- ex. sorting, searching, shuffling

Collection Framework Hierarchy:
- Iterable<E>(I) extended by collection
- Collection<E>(I) ----> List<E>(I) -------> ArrayList<E>(C)
                                    -------->Vector<E>(C)
                                    -------------------->LinkedList<E>(C)
                   ----> Queue<E>(I)---->Deque<E>(I)------------^ points up (Linked List)
                   ----> Set<E>(I)------->HashSet<E>(C)----->LinkedHashSet<E>(C)
                                  ------->SortedSet<E>(I)---->NavigableSet<E>(I)--->TreeSet<E>(C)

Map - it is not a child of collection, but it is a part of collection framework
    Map<K,V>(I)---->HashMap<K,V>(C)---->LinkedHashMap<K,V>(C)
               ----->SortedMap<K,V>(I)---->NavigableMap<K,V>(I)--->TreeMap<K,V>(C)

Iterator<E>(I) ---> has a relationship with collection (an object of iterator is present with collection)
               ---> ListIterator<E>(I) extends iterator (but its object is only available with list DS)
                                                         cannot be used by set)
