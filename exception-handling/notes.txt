What is an exception?
- it is an unexpected/ abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program and
abrupt the normal flow.

What is exception handling?
- it is a mechanism to handle the runtime exceptions without disturbing the normal flow of the program
and maintain it.

Exception hierarchy:

Throwable - it is the root class for all exceptions and errors
- it has 2 child classes --> Exception and Error

1. Error ---> These are some serious issues that occur and
              the program/ developer are not expected to handle it (ex. Memory Issues, Power issues)
              Errors - OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError
2. Exception ---> Represents problems that a program can catch and handle.
     1. Checked exceptions - These are exceptions that occur at compile time and
                             it must be handled or else we cannot proceed.
                             Some common exceptions (inherited from Exception) are
                             1. IOException - it has a child exception i.e FileNotFoundException
                             2. ClassNotFoundException
                             3. SQLException etc.
     2. Unchecked exceptions - These are exceptions that occur at runtime where we do not expect
                               developer to always handle them, since we are not sure when it can occur.
                               All the unchecked exceptions inherit from RuntimeException which inherits from Exception.
                               That is the RE is the parent class for all unchecked exceptions
                               Some common unchecked exceptions are
                               1. Arithmetic Exception
                               2. NullPointerException
                               3. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                               4. ClassCastException etc.

Ways to handle runtime exceptions which helps to maintain the normal flow of the program:
1. try-catch block
2. throw
3. throws
4. try-catch-finally
5. try-with-resources
6. hande using custom exceptions
